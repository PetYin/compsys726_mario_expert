# compsys726_mario_expert
The objective of this assignment is to implement your version of "mario_expert.py" to play the game of Super Mario from the original GameBoy.

This document provides all the instructions to setup and run the base random agent example and then how to create your own expert agent.

# Assignment Instructions
The objective is to develop an expert agent capable of playing Super Mario into "mario_expert.py".
The agent must be developed as an expert system - you are free to choose how you implement the expert, using any methodology or resources online that you wish.
The only exception is you are NOT allowed to utilise Machine Learning as that is not an expert system - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system.

The full details of the assignment marking and expectations of the report are laid out on Canvas: TODO

## Setup
Pull this package onto your computer into any directory you desire.

`git clone` the repository into your desired directory on your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/UoA-CARES/compsys726_mario_expert.git 
```

To run this package you must first install the required python packages. These packages are the base packages required to run the minimal example, you will most likely need to install additional packages to complete the assignment.

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the **root directory** of the package

Pull the mario ROM folder from the link below (University of Auckland emails only) and put into the roms folder in this package.

## Usage
To run this package you can simply call "run.py" and pass your UoA assigned upi as an arguement. The initial example agent is a random explorer who will simply randomly select actions to play the game. 

```
python3 run.py run --upi your_upi
```

You will see the game window open up and mario moving around randomly similar to the image below.

</p>

The results of the agent playing the game will be saved into 'results/your_upi' - this will record the final game stats and a video of the agent playing the game. 

## Implementation Requirements
The agent you implement must be entirely developed within the "mario_expert.py" file. 
NO other file is to be edited - the automated competition system will only use your "mario_expert.py" file. 
This is simply to enable automated competitions between your submissions.

You are free to modify and expand the classes inside of "mario_expert.py" and add additional features/functions required to implement your agent. This is not best coding practice but it makes the lecturers lives easier. 

## Agent Submission Process (Competition Only)
To submit your agent for the class Competition you need to upload your "mario_expert.py" file and "requirements.py" by following the steps below.

### Step 1 - Create updated requirements.txt
You need to create a requirements.txt that contains all the python packages you are using for your expert agent.
This can easily be generated by running 'pipreqs' in the **root directory** of the package.

```
pip3 install pipreqs
python3 -m pipreqs.pipreqs --force
```

### Step 2 - Upload Files to Google Drive
Following this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xM3Dhtm3YCoLnMFTMxyZnhJVvHsYbFgn?usp=sharing 

Create a folder using your upi as the name. 

Copy the new 'requirements.txt' and 'mario_expert.py' files into the folder.
